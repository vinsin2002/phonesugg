It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.\n *\n * If you'd still like to build password-based authentication for your application despite these risks, Auth.js gives you full control to do so.\n *\n * :::\n *\n * See the [callbacks documentation](/reference/core#authconfig#callbacks) for more information on how to interact with the token. For example, you can add additional information to the token by returning an object from the `jwt()` callback:\n *\n * ```js\n * callbacks: {\n *   async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {\n *     if (user) {\n *       token.id = user.id\n *     }\n *     return token\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * import Auth from \"@auth/core\"\n * import Credentials from \"@auth/core/providers/credentials\"\n *\n * const request = new Request(\"https://example.com\")\n * const response = await AuthHandler(request, {\n *   providers: [\n *     Credentials({\n *

response = await fetch(request)\n *         if(!response.ok) return null\n *         return await response.json() ?? null\n *       }\n *     })\n *   ],\n *   secret: \"...\",\n *   trustHost:
